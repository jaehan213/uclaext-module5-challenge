Work Day Scheduler

The project was completed along the guidelines for UCLA Extension's Module 5 Challenge.

The application deploys a scheduler for the typical work day in the US of 9:00 am - 5:00 pm working hours. The user can input their tasks for the day into the given text areas and save their inputs with the save button.

The current date is displayed in the header along with the current time. 

Once the current time passes the hour mark for each row, the row's text area changes color. The rows' colors define whether the task hour is in the past, present, or future.
